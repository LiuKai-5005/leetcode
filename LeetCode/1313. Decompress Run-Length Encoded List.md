# 1313. Decompress Run-Length Encoded List

:green_heart:

We are given a list `nums` of integers representing a list compressed with run-length encoding.



Consider each adjacent pair of elements `[a, b] = [nums[2*i], nums[2*i+1]]` (with `i >= 0`).  For each such pair, there are `a` elements with value `b` in the decompressed list.

Return the decompressed list.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,4,4,4]
Explanation: The first pair [1,2] means we have freq = 1 and val = 2 so we generate the array [2].
The second pair [3,4] means we have freq = 3 and val = 4 so we generate [4,4,4].
At the end the concatenation [2] + [4,4,4,4] is [2,4,4,4].

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 100
nums.length % 2 == 0
1 <= nums[i] <= 100




```python
class Solution:
    def decompressRLElist(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        ans = []
        for i in range(0, len(nums), 2):
            ans += [nums[i+1]] * nums[i]
        return ans
```
